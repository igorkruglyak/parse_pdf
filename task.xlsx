Zhu Shen ,"Institute of Dermatology and Venereology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital ",,P100,IMMUNOLOGICAL MEMORY EXISTS IN THE RECURRENT LESION AND NONRECURRENT SKIN AFTER REMISSION IN PSORIATIC PATIENTS ,"Introduction: Psoriasis usually recurs in previously affected areas, so a pathogenic memory has been proposed, but the nature of such site-specific recurrent memory is not completely known. Tissuresident memory T (TRM) cells are non-recirculating memory T cells that persist long-term in epithelial tissues, including the skin. Because they can localize in the skin for many months, we spculate that TRM may contribute to recurrent pathology of psoriasis. Objectives: The aim of the present study is to compare the diferences of quantity proportion and secretion ability of cytokines of the TRM cells between recurrent and nonrecurrent lesions following remission, as well as to explicit the possible survival signal for these TRM cells in psoriatic lesion. Methods: RNA-Seq, Gene Ontology and KEGG analysis, real-time PCR, flow cytometer analysis/sorting, cell stimulation assay, and western blot were used to explore the immunological memory. Results: Compared with normal skin, there are common shared genes significantly upregulated ( > 2 folds, p < 0.001) by recurrent and nonrecurrent lesions, including CD69. CD69 mRNA transcrition level in nonrecurrent lesions after remission remains as high as in neighboring recurrent lesions. CD8+CD69+ TRM cells exist in both lesions, and they can secret almost same amount of IL-17A and IL-22 after stimulation. Levels of IL-15, secreted by keratnocytes in psoriasis epidermis, in nonrecurrent lesions remain as high as in neighboring recurrent lesions, and recombinant human IL-15 can induce CD69 on TRM cells. Conclusions: Our preliminary study shows that CD8+CD69+ TRM cells persist in clinically resolved psoriatic lesions whether it recurs or not, and they can produce IL-17A and IL-22 with critical effect on psoriatic recurrence and development. Furthermore, we have indicated the IL-15 may play crucial role in the survival of CD8+CD69+ TRM cells in psoriatic lesions. References: 1.

"Samar Gupta, Alicja Wasilewski ","University of Michigan, MI State ",,P101,"INVESTIGATING SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION AS THE COMMON LINK BETWEEN DEPRESSION, PSORIASIS, AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS IN US VETERANS ","Introduction: Psychosocial factors are important in the onset and/ or exacerbation of psoriasis in 40% to 80% of cases. Psoriasis has been associated with suicide, and an increased prevalence of alcoholism and a range of personality characteristics. A recent systematic meta-analysis of 98 eligible studies with a total of 401,703 psoriasis patients showed that patients with psoriasis were approximately one and a half times more likely to exhibit signs of depression compared with healthy controls. [1]. Emerging evidence suggests that depression, like psoriasis, is associated with systemic inflammation, and the systemic inflamatory profile of the two conditions show similar traits. Depression is considered to have a strong inflammatory component, similar to psoriasis, e.g. interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-12, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α [2–5]. US Veteran population has increased incidence of mental health issue as compared to general population. making Veteran group a unique population that warrants investigation. Objectives: Hypotheses - 1/ Veterans with concomitant depresion and psoriasis/PsA may have elevated inflammatory markers like CRP, ESR, and SPEP. 2/ Depression may improve with the treatment of psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis without antidepressant use. Methods: A 36-month retrospective chart review of 100 veterans with diagnosis of depression and psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis. Elevated inflammatory markers, including sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), as well as longitudinal disease course of depression (PHQ-8) and psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis (HAQ-DI); specifically disease activity, and depression symptoms will be assessed. We then aim to draw a correlation between disease activity and active depressive symptoms. Results: to be available Conclusions: to be available References: 1. Dowlatshahi EA, et al.

It resembles guttate psoriasis but lesions are larger, are chronic, and are not associated with streptococcal infection. We have observed SPP develop in four different population groups; patients under TNFα-inhibitor therapy, patients under immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) terapy, and patients with concurrent SLE or ANA positivity and psoriasis. Subtypes of psoriasis develop on a spectrum between autoimmune and auto-inflammatory responses and an interplay between three signalling pathways are involved in their distinct pathogenesis. Chronic plaque psoriasis lesions are on the autoimune spectrum, dominated by a T-cell mediated TNFα/IL-23/ IL-17/IL-22 axis. Pustular psoriasis is a neutrophilic infiltrative inflammatory skin disease resulting from dysregulation of the IL-36/IL-1 axis. Lastly, TNFα-inhibitor (TNFi) induced lesions have a SPP morphology and demonstrate increased expression of LL37 by keratinocytes, activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells and upregulated type-1 interferons (IFN). These lesions express fewer epidermal CD8 T cells. Objectives: Our aim is to characterize the immune-phenotype of SPP in multiple clinical scenarios. We hypothesize that SPP develops as a result of increased expression of cytokines and antimicrobial peptides involved in the type-1 IFN pathway. Methods: Skin biopsies were obtained from three patients with  TNFi-induced psoriasis, three patients with SLE and psoriasis, three patients with positive ANA and psoriasis, two patients with ICI-induced psoriasis and two patients with chronic plaque psorisis as control. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antbodies against type-1 IFN induced MXA, LL37, IL-36 and CD8 T cells. The intensity and the area of positively stained samples were each graded from 0–4 and then multiplied to provide a final score. Results: Small plaque lesions in various clinical scenarios had hitologic changes consistent with psoriasis.. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed an increased expression of MXA (TNFi = 14, SLE = 13.3, ANA = 11.3, ICI = 16 vs. control = 6, t-test p < 0.05), LL37 (TNFi = 10.8, SLE = 6, ANA = 9.7, ICI = 12 vs. control = 2, t-test p < 0.05) and IL-36 (TNFi = 10.5, SLE = 13.3, ANA = 11, ICI = 7, control = 0.25, t-test p < 0.05) in the keratinocytes of SPP patients. There was decreased CD8 T cell migration to the epidermis in SPP compared to control. Conclusion: This is the first study to describe the immunphenotype of SPP and to extend the phenotype observed in TNFi induced psoriasis to varying clinical scenarios. There was an increased expression of MXA, LL-37 and IL-36 as well as fewer epidermal CD8 T cells than in chronic plaque psoriasis consitent with the type-1 IFN pathway of psoriasis pathogenesis. This immune-phenotypic analysis may suggest tailored therapy for this form of psoriasis. "

The etiology of PsA is not well understood but evidence supports an interplay of genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors which promote pathological bone remodeling and joint damage in PsA. The glucocorticoid-inducible kinase-1(SGK1) is genomically uprgulated by cell stress. However, excessive SGK1 expression and activity participates in the pathophysiology of several disorders, such as inflammation, autoimmune disease, fibrosis, hypertension, thrombosis and tumor growth. Objectives: In this study, we analyzed the possible role of serum SGK-1 levels in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis. Methods: 56 patients with psoriasis (40 patients with psoriatic arthritis; 16 female, 24 male, mean age; 46.7 ± 6.5 years, mean disease duration 17.7 ± 4.3 years and 16 patients without arthritis; 8 female, 8 male, mean age; 43.2 ± 1.9 years, mean disease duration; 14.1 ± 3.9 years) and 19 healthy controls (11 female, 8 male; mean age 41.3 ± 4.7 years) were enrolled in this study. Oligoarthritis was the commonest clinical presentation (76.4 %). Dactylitis (73.4%) and enthesitis (48.1%) were frequent extra-articular features. All patients were negative for rheumatoid factor. HLA-B27 was negative in 14 patients. Serum SGK-1 levels were determined by ELISA. Results: The mean serum SGK-1 levels were 58.4 ± 18.1 pg/ml in healthy controls, 163.7 ± 27.8 pg/ml in patients without arthritis and 443.9 ± 32.1 pg/ml in patients with arthritis. Serum SGK-1 levels were significantly high in patients with psoriasis compared with healthy controls (p < 0.001). Serum SGK-1 levels were sinificantly high in patients with psoriatic arthritis compared with in patients without psoriatic arthritis (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The evidence is strong that immunological mechnisms are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. In this study, we demonstrated that serum SGK-1 levels were significantly elevated in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. 43 "

Genetic interaction between ERAP1 variants and HLA-class I alleles determines the genetic risk for various HLclass I-associated inflammatory diseases. Epistasis between HLC*06:02 and ERAP1 variants affects also psoriasis risk but the mechanisms of these gene interactions remained unknown. Using a pathogenic Vα3S1/Vβ13S1-TCR from a psoriatic CD8+ T-cell clone we had shown that in psoriasis, HLA-C*06:02 mediates an autoimmune response against melanocytes through autoantigen presentation and we had identified a peptide from ADAMTS-like protein 5 (ADAMTSL5) as HLA-C*06:02-presented melanocyte autoantigen. Objectives: To determine the role of ERAP1 variants in psoriasis pathogenesis. Methods: We established ERAP1 knockout cells using CRISPR/ Cas9 system. ERAP1 knockout cells transfected with plasmids coding for HLA-C*06:02, ERAP1 variants, and antigenic petides were co-cultured with the TCR hybridoma to determine the levels of TCR ligation which reflect the generation of the antigenic ADAMTSL5 peptide and other Vα3S1/Vβ13S1-TCR ligands from precursors. Results: Our data show that NH2-terminal trimming by ERPA1 is required to generate the actual antigenic ADAMTSL5 peptide from NH2-terminally elongated precursors. An ERAP1 variant protecting from psoriasis reduced the immunogenicity of the antigenic ADAMTSL5 peptide presumably through overtrimming and peptide destruction, whereas a psoriasis risk variant of ERAP1 highly kept the antigenicity of the autoantigen. This effect was specific for ADAMTSL5. Precursors of other Vα3S1/Vβ13STCR self-ligands were not substrates of ERAP1. Conclusions: Using a proven psoriatic autoantigen and a cognate psoriatic TCR, these experiments provide direct evidence that gene-gene interaction between ERAP1 and HLA-C*06:02 affects the risk for psoriasis through differential autoantigen trimming from precursors. These data furthermore propose a model where ERAP1 function essentially controls the autoantigenic potential of self-peptides in HLA-class I associated CD8+ T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases. "
"Secil Vural, Yukiyasu Arakawa, Adrian Galinski, Sigrid Vollmer, Akiko Arakawa, Jörg Prinz ",Ludwig Maximilian University ,,P106,ENVIRONMENTAL TRIGGERS OF AN HLAC*06:02 RESTRICTED AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE IN PSORIASIS ,"Introduction: Psoriasis vulgaris is a multifactorial disease. While the major psoriasis risk gene HLA-C*06:02 accounts for up to 50% of disease onset, environmental factors are considered to contribute to approximately 30% of disease risk. Psoriatic skin inflammation is driven by an HLA-C*06:02-mediated autoimmune response against melanocytes. A pathogenic Vα3S1/Vβ13S1 T-cell receptor (TCR), which we had reconstituted from a lesional epdermal CD8+ T-cell clone of an HLA-C*06:02–positive psoriasis patient in a mouse reporter hybridoma cell line, specifically reacts against melanocytes through HLA-C*06:02 restricted recognition of a psoriatic melanocyte autoantigen, ADAMTS-like protein 5 (ADAMTSL5). However, it is unknown whether and how enviro mental factors may contribute to autoimmunity in psoriasis. TCRs are known to be polyspecific, recognizing multiple peptide ligands which share a conserved amino acid pattern specific for each TCR. Objectives: To examine the potential role of environmental factors in the psoriatic autoimmune response. Methods: We first determined the particular amino acid motif which is recognized by the psoriatic Vα3S1/Vβ13S1 TCR in the context of HLA-C*06:02. By homology searches using this conserved amino acid pattern, we selected 57 peptides from food, bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens and from the skin and intestinal microbiomes as candidate environmental antigens that may trigger the psoriatic autoimmune response. We cloned the peptides into expression plasmids, co-transfected them with HLC*06:02 into Cos7 cells and used them to stimulate the Vα3S1/ Vβ13S1 TCR. TCR ligation was determined by GFP induction of TCR hybridoma in FACS analysis. We then stimulated blood lymphocytes with the candidate peptides that had ligated the Vα3S1/Vβ13S1 TCR. Lymphocyte activation was assessed by induction of activation markers and proliferation assays using thymidine incorporation. Results: We identified a variety of peptides contained in proteins from food (wheat, coffee, apple, and spinach), microbiota of hman skin or gut, and infectious pathogens including Chlamydia trachomatis, which ligated the psoriatic TCR in a polyspecific manner. Stimulation of blood lymphocytes with particular canddate antigens resulted in significant activation in psoriasis patients, as compared to healthy individuals. Interindividual-correlation analyses demonstrated cross-reactive immune responses between environmental antigens and the melanocyte autoantigen preseted by HLA-C*06:02 in psoriasis patients. Among the candidate antigens, wheat peptides induced most robust lymphocyte activtions in psoriasis patients. Moreover, psoriasis was significantly improved by wheat-free diet in several patients with lymphocytes responding to wheat, indicating potential pathogenic contribution of wheat antigens in psoriasis. Conclusions: Our results provide unbiased evidence that several environmental antigens may trigger the melanocyte-specific autoimmune response in psoriasis. By identifying and avoiding those triggers at the molecular level which translate the genetic predisposition into disease manifestation, we may develop strtegies to prevent disease onset and exacerbation.
